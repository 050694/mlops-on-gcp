# Scheduling log analyzer runs

This folder contains a simple CLI - `dms` - designed to facilitate triggering and scheduling of the Log Analyzer runs.

The `dms` utility supports two commands: 
- `run` - The `run` command triggers an immediate run of the Log Analyzer template
- `schedule` - The `schedule` command allows you to schedule a run of the Log Analyzer template in future. 

## Installing the `dms` utility
